# PutEmToSleep  
**PutEmToSleep** is a fun and engaging 2D basketball game in pixel-art style, built using Python and Pygame.  
The game simulates a simple basketball experience where you can become Stephen Curry and attempt to shoot hoops.

In this game, players can shoot threes and pull-ups from half-court. When you hit "green," a "night night" emoji will appear, representing Stephen Curry's signature celebration.
